= Wiki Phrases

A wiki phrase belongs to one of the categories ''fixme'', ''todo'' or ''done'',
and is highlighted to catch attention. Any delimiter `():<>` adjacent to a
phrase will not be presented. This makes it possible to naturally write, for
example, `FIXME:` in a wiki text, but view the phrase highlighted without the
colon (`:`) which would not look natural.

Use the following phrases to highlight problems, todos and results thereof:

 [[ShowPhrases]]

Prefixing a phrase with `!` prevents it from being highlighted.

Example:
 ||= Wiki markup =||= Display =||
{{{#!td
{{{
FIXME: Something weird is going on
}}}
}}}
 || FIXME: Something weird is going on ||
