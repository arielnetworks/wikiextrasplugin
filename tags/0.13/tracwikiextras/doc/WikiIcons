= Wiki Icons
More than 3.000 icons are available using the following wiki markup:
{{{
(|name, size|)
}}}
This shows a named icon that can be in line with text, where
 * `name` is the name of the icon.
 * `size` is optionally one of `small`, `medium` or `large` or an abbreviation
   thereof (defaults `small`).

Examples:
 ||= Wiki markup =||= Display =||
{{{#!td
{{{
(|trac|) and (|subversion|) is like (|yin-yang|)
}}}
}}}
 ||  (|trac|) and (|subversion|) is like (|yin-yang|)  ||
{{{#!td
{{{
(|trac|) (|trac, medium|) (|trac, large|)
}}}
}}}
 ||  (|trac|) (|trac, medium|) (|trac, large|)  ||
{{{#!td
{{{
(|clock|) (|calendar|) (|chart|) (|eye|) (|tick|)
}}}
}}}
 ||  (|clock|) (|calendar|) (|chart|) (|eye|) (|tick|)  ||



When `name` contains a pattern character (`*` or `?`), a 2-column preview of
matching icons is presented, which should mainly be used for finding and
selecting an icon during wiki page editing in side-by-side mode. (The number of
displayed icons is limited to prevent exhaustive network traffic. Use
`ShowIcons` for static presentation of available icons.)

Example of the 2-column search preview:
{{{
(|arrow*|)
}}}
 (|arrow*|)

Narrow down your search until you find the wanted icon.

The [WikiMacros#Icon-macro Icon macro] is equivalent to this wiki markup.


== Smileys
Following character sequences are defined as ''smileys'' and are automatically
displayed as icons:

 [[ShowSmileys]]

Example:
 ||= Wiki markup =||= Display =||
{{{#!td
{{{
This is a great feature :-)
}}}
}}}
 ||  This is a great feature :-)  ||

Prefixing a smiley character sequence with an exclamation mark (`!`) prevents
it from being interpreted as a smiley.

The list above was generated by the
[WikiMacros#ShowSmileys-macro ShowSmileys macro]. See also
[TracIni#wikiextras-smileys-section TracIni], for configuration of smileys.


== !ShowIcons macro
Use the [WikiMacros#ShowIcons-macro ShowIcons macro] to display a list of
available icons. (The number of displayed icons is limited to prevent
exhaustive network traffic.)

Syntax:
{{{
[[ShowIcons(cols, name-pattern, size, header, limit)]]
}}}
where
 * `cols` is optionally the number of columns in the table (defaults 3).
 * `name-pattern` selects which icons to list (use `*` and `?`).
 * `size` is optionally one of `small`, `medium` or `large` or an abbreviation
   thereof (defaults `small`).
 * `header` is optionally one of `header` and `noheader` or an abbreviation
   thereof (header is displayed by default)
 * `limit` specifies an optional upper limit of number of displayed icons.

The last three optional parameters (`size`, `header` and `limit`) can be stated
in any order.

Example:
{{{
[[ShowIcons(smile*)]]              # all small icons matching smile*
[[ShowIcons(4, smile*)]]           # four columns
[[ShowIcons(smile*, 10)]]          # limit to 10 icons
[[ShowIcons(smile*, 10, nohead)]]  # no header
[[ShowIcons(smile*, m)]]           # medium-size
}}}

Another example:
{{{
[[ShowIcons(*, 26)]]
}}}
 [[ShowIcons(*, 26)]]
